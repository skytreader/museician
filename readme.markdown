# Museician

[Get this on Google Play!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.skytreader.museician&hl=en)

Citing related repos compels me to mention [this one](https://github.com/skytreader/museic).

Why the name? Because this is museic _for Android_. Now "museic" has its own
wordplay which I hope is much more obvious. \*wink\*\*wink\*.

# App Compatibility

This compiles to API 25: Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) and is tested to actually work
on Google Pixel with Android 8: Oreo. Caveat emptor, other handsets which differ
in configuration may experience bugs.

I welcome all and any [bug report](https://github.com/skytreader/museician/issues)
but I can't promise they will be fixed if they are not reproducible from my side.
