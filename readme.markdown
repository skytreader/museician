# Museician

Citing related repos compels me to mention [this one](https://github.com/skytreader/museic).

Why the name? Because this is museic _for Android_. Now "museic" hast its own
wordplay which I hope is much more obvious. \*wink\*\*wink\*.

# App Compatibility

This compiles to API 25: Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) and is tested to actually work
on Google Pixel with Nougat. Caveat emptor, other handsets with Nougat may
experience bugs.
